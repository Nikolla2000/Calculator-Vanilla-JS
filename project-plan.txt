// Create a calculator.
// arrange buttons for the numbers
// and for the arithetic operators + - * /
// also write option for clearing the current output
// output: above all buttons p tag which contains the current output on each button click
// EXAMPLE:
// user clicks: 5
//  - result: 5
// user clicks: +
//  - result: 5 +
// user clicks: 2
//  - result: 5 + 2
// user clicks: =
//  - result: 5 + 2 = 7

//  After = is clicked current state of the two numbers is cleared and waiting for new button clicks on the numbers
//  if new numbers is clicked - keep the previous result in a list above the current output

//  Constraints:
//   - we cannot start with an arithmetic operator
//   - we cannot add arithemtic operator after arithemtic operator
//   - show error is user is traying to divide in zero

//  *Our calculator will have a battery charged by the sun.
//  create percentage about it which will be 50% and will drop on every "=" click with 10%
//  if it is daytime raise the percentage on every 5 secons with 2 percents
//  if it is night time do nothing
//  and if the battery drops - show on the output PLEASE CHARGE/COME BACK IN THE MORNING

//  *Add option for float numbers
